# Emojive FrontEnd

Emojive is a unique chat service where communication is exclusively through emojis. Users can either join or create a known chatroom or be randomly paired with another user. The random pairing feature is designed to connect people from different parts of the world, especially those who don't share a common language, fostering a universal and visually expressive form of communication.

The full initial design doc for Emojive can be found [here](https://orchid-raft-257.notion.site/Emojive-2b8af8f7d1d1465f9149a1baa3523b8e?pvs=4)

The backend portion of this project is located in the [emojive-backend](https://github.com/thomasy314/emojive-backend) repository.

## Current State

The prototype of the front end has been complete and can be found in the `prototype` branch.
